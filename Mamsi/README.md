 MAMSI (Malicious Msi) is a python script able to extract scripts hidden within MSI files.
 Tested with Python 3.8+.
 
 The script will be used for more complicated tool that I'm working on and will be upgraded with time.
 
 The MSI file should be could "current.msi", you're welcome to change it.
 
 Usage:
       shell> python mamsi.py
